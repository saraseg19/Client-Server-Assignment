# Client-Server-Assignment
This project was an assignment for my network class. In this assignment, we had to create two Java programs that acted as a client and a server. 

The requirements for the server program were:
- Keep a list of input commands
- Implement the commands
	- Add : adds input value to the inputValues list
	- Remove: removes all instaces of input value from the inputValue list
	- GetSummation : adds all values in inputValues list and respond with total
	- GetMinimum : finds the smallest value in inputValues list
	- GetMaximum : finds the largest value in inputValues list
	- Exit : stops the connection between server and client 
- Send appropriate response, success or failure, back to the client program 

The requirements for the client program were:
- Print a list of commands the user can enter
- Display the response from the server program
